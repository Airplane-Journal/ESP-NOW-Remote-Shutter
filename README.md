Remote shutter button for Adafruit Memento with ESP-NOW

Been running into a frustrating safe mode issue with the Memento when its plugged into the rpi, like the rpi tries to mount the sd card and the Circuitpy drive, but then works okay when not plugged into USB.  Happens on even the simplest "Hello World" code.py.  Tried reinstalling CircuitPython without success.  I need to go look at the safe mode learn guide.
